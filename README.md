# tests for tray.io

This feels like work.

I've put together some very simple BDD test based on the example given.

To run:

Install rvm

`\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`

Install the ruby version 2.1.2, becuase thats the one I am using

`rvm install 2.1.2`

Install bundler gem

`gem install bundler`

Navigate to this code and bundle install

`bundle install`

Finally run the tests

`cucumber -p test `

This will produce a nice html report called test.html to view the results
